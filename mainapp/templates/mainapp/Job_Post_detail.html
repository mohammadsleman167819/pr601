The first interesting thing we haven't seen before is the function book.bookinstance_set.all(). 
This method is "automagically" constructed by Django in order to return the set of BookInstance records 
associated with a particular Book.

This method is needed because you declare a ForeignKey (one-to many) field only in the "many" side 
of the relationship (the BookInstance). 
Since you don't do anything to declare the relationship in the other ("one") model, 
it (the Book) doesn't have any field to get the set of associated records. 
To overcome this problem, Django constructs an appropriately named "reverse lookup" function that you can use. 
The name of the function is constructed by lower-casing the model name where the ForeignKey was declared, 
followed by _set (i.e. so the function created in Book is bookinstance_set()).  
  
  <div style="margin-left:20px;margin-top:20px">
    <h4>Copies</h4>

    {% for copy in book.bookinstance_set.all %}
      <hr />
      <p
        class="{% if copy.status == 'a' %}text-success{% elif copy.status == 'm' %}text-danger{% else %}text-warning{% endif %}">
        {{ copy.get_status_display }}
      </p>
      {% if copy.status != 'a' %}
        <p><strong>Due to be returned:</strong> {{ copy.due_back }}</p>
      {% endif %}
      <p><strong>Imprint:</strong> {{ copy.imprint }}</p>
      <p class="text-muted"><strong>Id:</strong> {{ copy.id }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
This function is automatically created because BookInstance.status is a choices field. 
Django automatically creates a method get_FOO_display() 
for every choices field "Foo" in a model, 
which can be used to get the current value of the field.
